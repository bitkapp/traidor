  * theres supposed to be a private websocket channel that informs when orders get filled. use it.
  
  * show_depth(): dislay "own volume" only if on correct side (ask/bid), otherwise pending order might be displayed as bid instead of ask or vice versa
  
  * load trading fee from getInfo(), not configfile
  
  * try "p1": the asks or bids might end earlier than their respective counterpart. display some "          " instead of letting trades bleed in
  
  * GamblingPurveyor: "Also, the program should check the $LINES and $COLUMNS environment variables every time it updates the screen, instead of having to set it manually with the [i]d[/i] menu option."
  
  * cmd "[hi]story" to download mtgox trading history and display it
  
  * after switching precision, display is still wrongly showing own orders (when data still not loaded), so lock display or something
